# Number-Guessing-Java-Game-

This is a Java-based number guessing game where players must input two numbers and see if they meet the mystical, randomly generated conditions to pass the trial. If you succeedâ€”congrats! The door opens. If not... well, better luck next time.

Thereâ€™s even a special "sandwich bonus" for the chosen ones (if you know, you know).

I had a blast making this, and if you enjoy quirky little games with some randomness and a touch of stubbornnessâ€”give it a try! ðŸ˜†
How It Works:

    The game asks the player to input two numbers.
    It compares them against two random numbers (0-20 and 0-30).
    If the player's numbers meet the mysterious criteria, they pass the trial and may proceed.
    If they fail, they must keep trying until they get it right.
    Special Easter egg if both numbers are 20.

Run It Yourself:

    Clone this repo
    Compile & run with javac MyProgram.java && java MyProgram
    Enter your numbers and pass the trialâ€¦ if you can! ðŸ˜ˆ
